# 3ftx_toxicity

## Description
The project focuses on understanding the basis of three finger toxin toxicity and identfying different structural
markers that contribute to this. I use R for various analyses in the project and have compiled some of the improtant codes here.
Each R script is commented and gives step by step information on what to do, please follow them fro guidance. 
All the necessary packages and libraries are included in the R scripts. 

## Structure
- `aggregate_area.R` - This script automates the process of counting the number of protein aggregates in C.elegans under fluroscent microscope and finds the area of the aggregate. 
- `for_checking_distances_between_specific_residues_and_toxin_atoms.R` - This script was written to calculate atomic distances between atoms of residues in different chains of a PDB model. 
- `for_minimising_RMSD_hydropathies_and_fixing_align.R` - This script was written to calculate normalised hydropathies of protein sequences and this helped us reach 
a consensus alignment in the project.
- `to_clean_the_ZDOCK_files_for_chimera.R` - This script cleans the result file generated by ZDOCK docking software post docking and helps me visualize the complex in chimera.
